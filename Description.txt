Hello,

This is my technical challenge for the frontend web development team. 

Here are the basic ideas of my project.

There are three main pages: 
- Courses.txt
- Cart.txt
- Receipt.txt

State management
    - For state management, I used Redux. I stored the current courses the user added to cart, as well as the details of each course
      offered in Course.json. To get these details such as difficulty and course quality, I used PennLabs API (retrieve course)

1) Courses.ts displays all the different courses available to students in as provided in the Courses.json file. I custom designed 
and programmed the visual components. Clicking on the arrow down button allows the user to read the details of the course. 
    - Search bar
        - Users can filter courses by description, name, or number
    - Filter dropdown
        - Users can filter courses by selecting a range for course numbers. 
    - Add to cart
        - Users can add to cart by clicking the add to cart button. 
        - This updates redux store for user courses in cart.

2) Adding to Cart updates the red notification component (top right) and also updates the cart in Carts.ts.
    - You can look at the cart by clicking on cart in the top navigation. 
    - You can review all the added courses
    - There is a button called "Checkout" which will bring users to a receipt page. 
    - The information of all the courses checked out is brought to the receipt page using query parameters.

3) The receipts page
    - The receipts page is simply a visual summary of all the courses checked out.
